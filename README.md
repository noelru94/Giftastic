## What is Giftastic
* Giftastic is a giphy generator, using The GIPHY API

## How it works
* The user is given 6 buttons with animal names. 
* When the user clicks on a button, an ajax 'GET' request is sent to the GIPHY API.
* Once the request is fulfilled, 10 still images are display onto the screen.
* The user can click an image to change the data-state to animate. Bringing the giphy to life.
* The user is also given an option to search more animals, via search form.
* When the user clicks search, a button will dynamically be generated and put along side the original 6 buttons
